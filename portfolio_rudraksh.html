                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>This project transforms the classic Flappy Bird game by using AI and OpenCV to enable hand gesture control. Instead of traditional controls, players use a webcam to raise or lower their hand, which AI interprets in real-time to adjust the bird's altitude. Key features include smooth gesture recognition, AI-powered control, and customizable sensitivity for a tailored experience. OpenCV handles real-time hand detection, while Python and Pygame manage game logic and visuals. The process involves capturing hand movements via webcam, detecting and interpreting gestures with AI, and translating them into in-game bird movements. This innovative project showcases the potential of AI and computer vision for creating immersive, hands-free gaming experiences.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>The Coding Thug Life filter is a playful overlay effect inspired by the "Thug Life" meme, tailored for developers to celebrate coding achievements humorously. It adds sunglasses and a pixelated cigar over the person’s face, with coding-themed text like "Hello World!" or "Code is life." The background might feature matrix-style code effects, and dramatic music enhances the victorious, meme-like feel. This fun filter is perfect for light-hearted moments, like after solving a tough coding problem or launching a new project, highlighting a developer's "coolness" in coding with a humorous twist.</p>

                <h3>Project 3</h3>
                <p>This simple book-buying website demonstrates e-commerce fundamentals. It features **book listings** with titles, prices, and a "Buy Now" button. When a user clicks "Buy Now," a **dynamic payment form** appears, prefilled with the book’s title and price. The form includes fields for **card number**, **expiry date**, and **CVC**, with **payment validation** ensuring all fields are correctly filled before proceeding. Upon successful payment, a **confirmation message** appears, thanking the user and confirming the transaction. This project highlights user interface design, form validation, and dynamic JavaScript functionality..</p>

This image showcases my achievements in roller hockey. As a national gold medalist and former captain of Team Haryana, which I led for over five years, I have won numerous medals and accolades in this sport. Each medal represents a milestone in my journey, reflecting dedication, teamwork, and leadership in high-stakes competitions. These accomplishments highlight my commitment to excellence and resilience on and off the rink, qualities that I bring to every endeavor.
