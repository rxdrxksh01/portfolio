                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>Flappy Bird with AI and Hand Gesture Control Using OpenCV

This project is a unique take on the classic Flappy Bird game, where instead of using traditional keyboard or mouse controls, players can control the bird’s movements using hand gestures detected by a camera in real-time, thanks to OpenCV and AI integration.

Key Features:

Hand Gesture Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV for hand-tracking and gesture recognition. The AI model interprets hand movements, such as raising or lowering your hand, to control the bird's altitude.

AI-Powered Control: The game integrates machine learning algorithms to accurately detect and translate hand movements into in-game actions.

Smooth Real-Time Interaction: The combination of OpenCV and AI allows for smooth, real-time gameplay, with minimal delay between hand movements and bird response.

No Physical Controllers: The entire game can be played without any physical controllers or devices—just your hand and a camera!

Customizable Sensitivity: Players can adjust the sensitivity of the hand-tracking model to suit their comfort, ensuring an enjoyable gaming experience for all skill levels.

Tech Stack:

OpenCV: For real-time computer vision tasks like hand detection and tracking.

Python: The primary programming language for developing the game and integrating AI with OpenCV.

Pygame: Used to recreate the Flappy Bird game environment, rendering the visuals and managing game logic.

How It Works:

Camera Input: The player’s webcam captures hand movements.

Hand Detection: OpenCV processes the input video and detects the player's hand in real-time.

Gesture Interpretation: The AI model classifies hand gestures (e.g., upward movement to make the bird fly).

In-Game Control: Based on the gesture, the bird's movement is adjusted within the game.

This project showcases the integration of AI with computer vision, taking traditional gaming to the next level by creating a hands-free gaming experience. The combination of gesture recognition and a familiar game like Flappy Bird makes this project both fun and a practical demonstration of real-time AI applications.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>A Coding Thug Life filter is a fun and creative overlay effect typically used in photos or videos to give a "cool" or humorous vibe. It originated from the "Thug Life" meme, which features dramatic, comedic situations followed by sunglasses, a pixelated cigar, and text reading "Thug Life" appearing over the person’s face.

In a coding-themed version, this filter could be applied to a developer or programmer, highlighting their "coolness" or achievements in coding. It might include elements like:

Sunglasses and cigar overlaid on the face.

Coding-themed text like "Hello World!" or "Code is life."

Digital effects like matrix-style code falling in the background.

Dramatic music or sound effects that give a meme-like, victorious feel.

This could be used for light-hearted moments, like after completing a tough coding challenge, debugging a complex issue, or launching a project successfully.</p>

                <h3>Project 3</h3>
                <p>This project is a simple book-buying website that demonstrates e-commerce fundamentals. It allows users to browse books and securely enter payment information to make purchases. Key features include:

Book Listings: Displays available books with titles, prices, and a “Buy Now” button for each book.
Dynamic Payment Form: When users click "Buy Now," a payment form appears with the selected book’s title and price prefilled.
Payment Validation: The form includes fields for card number, expiry date, and CVC, requiring all fields to be filled out before proceeding.
Confirmation Message: Upon successful payment, a confirmation message replaces the form, confirming the transaction.
This project highlights user interface design, form validation, and dynamic JavaScript functionality for handling payments and feedback.</p>
